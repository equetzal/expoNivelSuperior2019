<p>The National Polytechnic Institute, it´s the most prestigious university in Mexico in the field of Engineering. This institute carries out a series of activities in order to publicize its educational offer, one of these activities is the “University Academic Offer Exposition”. Due to the austerity state of the government of Mexico given in 2019, it was necessary to change all the information, traditionally printed, to an app that shows all the information related to the educational offer of the institute, the academic units and the study plans in its interface.</p>

<p>The main objective of the app is to allow applicants to know the academic offer of the institute and the offers of  each university degree as well as its main objectives, the study plan, the work areas and the activities that they usually carry out in the field of work. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It allows you to navigate through schools, so you can see the location of their campuses, and the careers that each campus offers.<br>
There is also a search by career, in which you can see at which schools of the institute is the career being offered. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Due to the institute’s requirements, the app cannot maintain an internet connection at any given time nor store any type of user data.<br>
To solve this problem, we decided to load all the required information within the app, so that the app alone contains it. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
