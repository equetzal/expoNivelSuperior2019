<p>The National Polytechnic Institute, It is the most prestigious university in Mexico in the field of Engineering. This institute carries out a series of activities in order to publicize its educational offer and in this way obtain the best candidates in the country to study at its facilities. One of these activities is the so-called “Expo Profesiográfica de Nivel Superior” (That is, at the university level). Due to the austerity of the government of Mexico given in 2019, it was necessary to change all the information traditionally printed by an app that shows all the information related to the educational offer of the institute, the academic units and the study plans.</p>

<p>The main objective of the app is to allow applicants to know the academic offer of the institute and what each university degree offers as well as its main objectives, the study plan, the work areas and the activities that they usually carry out in the world of work. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It allows you to navigate through schools, so you can see the location of the campus and the careers that campus offers you.<br>
There is also a navigation by schools, in which you can see in which schools of the institute the career you are looking for is offered. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2>
<p>Due to the institute’s requirements, the app cannot maintain an internet connection or store absolutely any user data due to the institute’s academic purposes.<br>
To solve this problem, we decided to load all the required data within the app, so that the app alone contains all the information of the institute. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
